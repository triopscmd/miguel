# Project Plan: Cloud Ticketing Application

## Overview
This document outlines the project plan for developing a comprehensive cloud computing ticketing application. The application will facilitate ticket submission, agent management, resource linkage, user authentication, notifications, categorization, and performance reporting.

## Technology Stack
*   **Frontend**: React (with Vite) and TypeScript
*   **Styling**: TailwindCSS
*   **Backend**: Node.js (via tRPC or similar for API) and TypeScript
*   **Database**: PostgreSQL (or similar relational DB)
*   **ORM**: Prisma
*   **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions
